# RGS Web

The web frontend for the uORocketry Ground Station.

## Getting Started

Firstly, make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed (it's already installed with `devbox`).

Then, run the following

```bash
bun install # install dependencies
bun run dev # Start the development server
```

The development server will be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Keep in mind that the backend must be running for the web frontend to be effectively functional.
