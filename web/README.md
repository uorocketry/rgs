## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

So far you can only check the `logging` page where you can see how the mock data from `zmq/producer.ts` is being sent to the client in `src/routes/logging/+pages.svelte`.
