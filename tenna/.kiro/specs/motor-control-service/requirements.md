# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves reorganizing and professionalizing an existing Python project that controls ODrive motors. The system needs to provide a reliable motor control service that can operate in both simulation and hardware modes, with API endpoints and a web interface for demonstration and visualization. The current project has draft endpoints and motor control code that needs to be restructured into a professional, maintainable service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows Python best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN it SHALL follow standard Python project layout conventions
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN it SHALL have clear separation between API, business logic, and hardware interfaces
3. WHEN reviewing the project THEN it SHALL include proper configuration management for different environments
4. WHEN inspecting the code THEN it SHALL have consistent naming conventions and documentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want a reliable motor service that handles hardware detection and initialization, so that the system can gracefully handle both connected and disconnected motor scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL detect if ODrive hardware is connected
2. WHEN ODrive hardware is not available THEN the service SHALL fall back to simulation mode
3. WHEN ODrive hardware is connected THEN the service SHALL perform proper calibration and initialization
4. WHEN hardware errors occur THEN the service SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
5. WHEN the service initializes THEN it SHALL configure motors with the specified parameters (20:1 gearing, circular setpoints)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want RESTful endpoints to control motors, so that I can integrate motor control into other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the service SHALL provide endpoints for motor position control
2. WHEN requesting motor status THEN the API SHALL return current position, state, and error information
3. WHEN sending position commands THEN the API SHALL accept degree-based input and convert to motor turns
4. WHEN the system is in simulation mode THEN the API SHALL still respond with simulated motor behavior
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the service SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a demonstrator, I want a web interface to visualize and control motors, so that I can showcase the system capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN it SHALL display current motor position and status
2. WHEN using the interface THEN I SHALL be able to input target angles and send position commands
3. WHEN motors move THEN the interface SHALL provide real-time position feedback
4. WHEN the system is in simulation mode THEN the interface SHALL clearly indicate this state
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the interface SHALL display error messages to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper configuration and deployment setup, so that the service can be easily deployed and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the service THEN it SHALL have proper dependency management with requirements files
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support environment-based configuration (development, production)
3. WHEN running the service THEN it SHALL have proper logging for debugging and monitoring
4. WHEN starting the application THEN it SHALL have clear startup procedures and health checks
5. WHEN packaging the application THEN it SHALL include proper build and deployment scripts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing motor control logic preserved and enhanced, so that the current functionality is not lost during reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing the code THEN the existing ODrive configuration logic SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN controlling motors THEN the 20:1 gear ratio and circular setpoint functionality SHALL work as before
3. WHEN calibrating motors THEN the full calibration sequence SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN positioning motors THEN the shortest-path circular motion SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN integrating existing code THEN it SHALL be refactored into proper service classes and modules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase architecture simplified and standardized, so that it is maintainable and follows consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN it SHALL use consistent error handling patterns throughout all services
2. WHEN examining dependencies THEN the system SHALL use proper dependency injection instead of singleton patterns
3. WHEN analyzing state management THEN it SHALL be simplified without complex event systems that add unnecessary complexity
4. WHEN inspecting controller interfaces THEN they SHALL use a single, simplified interface without unnecessary abstractions
5. WHEN checking thread safety THEN the system SHALL use consistent async locking patterns without mixing sync/async approaches
6. WHEN validating configuration THEN it SHALL use a single, consolidated configuration approach with proper environment support
