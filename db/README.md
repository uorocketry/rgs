# DB

This folder contains database schema definitions and migration scripts. They are optimally ran inside a Docker container. But can also be ran manually.

## Database Setup

Our database needs to be set up before we can run the application. This is done by running the `bootstrap` script. This script will:

- Update the database schema using [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)

### üê≥ Running in Docker

**This is the recommended way**, the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file contains a `migration` service that runs the `bootstrap` script.
This script will automatically set up the database and run the migrations.

## Development

Changing the database schema is pretty easy. Just edit the files in the `schema/` folder and run `pnpm run push` to **update the database schema**.
Don't forget that database changes can break the application, so make sure to test your changes by rebuilding the application.
