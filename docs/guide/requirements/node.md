# Node

Though already installed with `devbox` to run node applications we also need to `cd` into their applications folder and run:

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

try it out with the `docs` folder.

Your terminal should look something like this:

![devcmd](/static/bundev.png)

If you can open it by going to <http://localhost:5173/rgs/> you are good to go!

We might be using a custom development https certificate, you might be prompted to "Go back to safety" or "Accept the risk and continue". You can safely ignore this warning.
