# Requirements

The ground station is built with multiple technologies, and as such, it has quite a few requirements to run.

Thankfully we use [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) to manage most of the environment requirements.

Check their [installation guide](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/) for your respective platform to get started.
