# Requirements

The ground station is built with multiple technologies, and as such, it has quite a few requirements to run.

Thankfully we use [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox) to manage most of the environment requirements.

Check their [installation guide](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/) for your respective platform to get started.

After installing devbox, navigate to rgs directory, and run `devbox shell` to install the necessary development dependencies and make it compatible with its environment (see devbox.json to see what this command is installing).
