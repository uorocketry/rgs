# Node

Though already installed with `devbox` to run node applications we also need to `cd` into their applications folder and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

try it out with the `web` folder.

Your terminal should look something like this:

![devcmd](/static/bundev.png)

If you can open it by going to <http://localhost:5173/> you are good to go!

> Tip: If the browser warns about an untrusted certificate in local dev, you can safely proceed.

Are you sure you are in the correct folder?

### failed to load config from vite.config.js ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND
