# Modifying the Database

Our schema is defined in the `db/schema/` directory. The schema is defined using the [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) and is written in TypeScript.

Please look at their [Schema Declaration Guide](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration) for more information.

Make sure to read the [Database README]([../db/README.md](https://github.com/uorocketry/rgs/tree/main/db)) for how to apply your changes.
